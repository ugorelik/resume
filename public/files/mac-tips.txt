Basics

Swiping

Four finger swipe up to see your desktop.
Four finger swipe down to see all of your open windows, that aren't open.

Switching Spaces

[control] + [left or right arrow key]

Minimizing/Hiding

On a mac you can hide and minimize. Hiding hides the application, you can show it again by alt tabbing to it. Minimizing puts an application to the bottom of a four finger swipe down. You cannot alt tab to a minimized tab. You either have to find it on your bar near the right or four finger swipe down and open it from there.

Alt 'Tilding'

Alt-Tabbbing only switches between distinct applications. If, for example, you have multiple firefox windows open, to switch between them you would use [alt] + [grave] (the key above tab ~).

Ejecting

To eject a disc either HOLD down the eject button or drag the CD (which should be on your desktop) into the trash.

Preview Files

To quickly look at a file without opening it and launching the corresponding program to open it, press [space] while the file is selected.




Shortcuts

Use spot light. [command] + [space] then type in the name of the application (or part of it) and hit enter.
