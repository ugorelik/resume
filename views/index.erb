<p>Hello, my name is Uri and I'm a Computer Science student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario Canada. I've finished my second year and I'm current on Co-op with Nav Canada.</p>

<p>Here you'll find my resume, portfolio and the the current projects that I'm working on! Also please be aware that I am still adding content to this site, for instance the portfolio page is completely empty at the moment.</p>

<p>And just a little caveat to be clear on the difference between the Projects page and the Portfolio page. The Projects page is where I list the things I am currently working on. They are usually things that I do in my spare time. The Portfolio page will hold all the projects I've worked on, be it for school or work. It will also contain projects that I have completed or currently not working on.</p>
