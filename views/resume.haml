  ## APPLIED PROJECTS

  ###  Data Structures

  Worked on several different types of data structures and thoroughly understood their implementation such as: rootish-array-stacks, heaps, “treaps”, BSTs, RBSTs, hash tables/maps, scapegoat trees and many more.

  ###  JOYBLIND Poster

  The JOYBLIND Poster is a tool for JOYBLIND.com that facilitates the posting/creation of new content. It hides the somewhat complex process of creating an HTML page to a novice user and allows anyone with basic computer skills to easily create new content. The program actually consists of two parts, a launcher and the client. The launcher adds a self-updating feature by checking for an update. If an update is found it then proceeds to download the latest version from a directory or if the current version is up to date it simply launches the available client. Some key processes include:

  *  Pulls live content from the server
  *  Formats and inserts text (according to proper HTML standards)
  *  Creates and updates proper XML files
  *  Formats posts/articles to required specifications
  *  Self-updating
