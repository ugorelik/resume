%p At Nav Canada I am responsible for extending and maintaining the Radar Test Suite (RTWS) and other programs. Currently I am working on extending functionality and fixing issues in a program called SPLAT. (Image bellow.)

%p The suite is written in C++.

%p I have also made a stand alone program that I use to test and debug some of the utilities in the suite.

%h2 Data Structures

%p
  Abstract Data Types and Algorithms, or "Data Structures", was one of my favourite courses. It was lead by a great professor at Carleton,

  and I really learned a lot.

%h2 JOYBLIND Poster
%p 
  The JOYBLIND Poster is a tool for JOYBLIND.com that facilitates the posting and creation of new content. It hides the somewhat complicated process of creating all of the appropriate HTML pages to a novice user and allows anyone with basic computer skills to easily create new content. The program actually consists of two parts, a launcher and the client. The launcher adds a self-updating feature by checking for an update. If an update is found it then proceeds to download the latest version from a directory or if the current cersion is up to date it simply launches the available client. Some key processes include:
  
%ul
  %li Pulls live content from the server
  %li Creates and updates proper XML files
  %li Formats posts/articles to required specifications
  %li Self-updating.
