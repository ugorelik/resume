	<h2>APPLIED PROJECTS</h2>

	<h3>Data Structures</h3>

	<p>Worked on several different types of data structures and thoroughly understood their implementation such as: rootish-array-stacks, heaps, “treaps”, BSTs, RBSTs, hash tables/maps, scapegoat trees and many more.</p> 

	<h3>JOYBLIND Poster</h3>

	<p>The JOYBLIND Poster is a tool for JOYBLIND.com that facilitates the posting/creation of new content. It hides the somewhat complex process of creating an HTML page to a novice user and allows anyone with basic computer skills to easily create new content. The program actually consists of two parts, a launcher and the client. The launcher adds a self-updating feature by checking for an update. If an update is found it then proceeds to download the latest version from a directory or if the current version is up to date it simply launches the available client. Some key processes include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Pulls live content from the server</li>
		<li>Formats and inserts text (according to proper HTML standards)</li>
		<li>Creates and updates proper XML files</li>
		<li>Formats posts/articles to required specifications</li>
		<li>Self-updating</li>
	</ul>
