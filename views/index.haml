  Hello, my name is Uri and I'm a Computer Science student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario Canada. I've finished my first two co-op terms with **NAV Canada** and **Reasearch in Motion**. I'm currently working with NDStoreFront as a Web Developer.

  Here you'll find my resume, portfolio and the current projects that I'm working on! Also please be aware that I am always adding content.
  
  I've also written a [whitepaper](pages/reaver-wps-threat-analysis) on the Reaver WPS attack recently, you should read it.
