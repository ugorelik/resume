%h2 Basics
%h3 Swiping
%p Four finger swipe up to see your desktop.
%p Four finger swipe down to see all of your open windows, that aren't open.
%h3 Switching Spaces
%p [control] + [left or right arrow key].
%h3 Minimizing/Hiding
%p On a mac you can hide and minimize. Hiding hides the application, you can show it again by alt tabbing to it. Minimizing puts an application to the bottom of a four finger swipe down. You cannot alt tab to a minimized tab. You either have to find it on your bar near the right or four finger swipe down and open it from there.

%h3 Alt 'Tilding'
%p Alt-Tabbbing only switches between distinct applications. If, for example, you have multiple firefox windows open, to switch between them you would use [alt] + [grave] (the key above tab ~).

%h3 Ejecting
%p To eject a disc either HOLD down the eject button or drag the CD (which should be on your desktop) into the trash.

%h3 Preview Files
%p To quickly look at a file without opening it and launching the corresponding program to open it, press [space] while the file is selected.
%h2 Shortcuts

%h3 Opening Files and Renaming
%p Windows users are probably going to be surprised that [enter] doesn't open files but rather prep the file for renaming. To open a file use [command]+[down-arrow]. [command]+[up-arrow] goes up a level and [command]+[left-arrow] collapses folders and [command]+[right-arrow] expands them.
%h3 Opening any application quickly
%p Use spot light. [command] + [space] then type in the name of the application (or part of it) and hit enter.
%h3 Quickly opening a Finder (Explorer Window)
%p Alt tab to finder and press [command]+[n].
%h3 Opening the Properties window for a File
%p Select a file and press [command] + [i].
%h2 Very Useful and Pretty Much Necessary Addons

%p A pop-up window that displays events. Almost every program uses, you'll probably end up installing it from something else.

%p This adds the ability to quickly resize windows faster. It also lets you move windows by placing your mouse over the window and holding down [control] + [alt] and then moving the mouse. You can resize windows by holding [shift]+[control]+[alt]. If you press [control]+[alt]+[arrow key] it pops the window to a side.
